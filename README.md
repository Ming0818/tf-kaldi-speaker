This library implements a speaker verification system based on Kaldi and TensorFlow. 
The feature extraction and voice active detection (VAD) is applied using Kaldi and the neural network is implemented by TF.
Again, the backend classifier is integrated using Kaldi. 

This is an initial version and will be further developed in the future. 
A detailed README will also be writen when I get the code working.

Please note that the code is under Apache 2.0. NO WARRANTY about the results.
